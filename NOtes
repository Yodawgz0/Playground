Redux

mangaing and updating using actions and , it acts like a centralized store where we can store all of the dat

1. Action -> What to do
2. Reducer -> contains state and the way to do it
3. store -> Object which holds the state of the application
4. Function -> createStore() getState disptach()

Action -> Reducer -> State

In Action we have Type which tell what to do but not what to do
action is created by a pure function and has this return object inside it

There can only be one store inw application

State is read only and the only way to change is using the dispatch
